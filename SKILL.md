description: "Capture decisions as individual markdown files with YAML frontmatter in a decisions/ directory. Works for any domain — engineering, research, health, creative, financial, personal, scientific, legal, or anything else. Use when the user says 'log this decision', 'record decision', 'capture this decision', 'update the decision log', 'what decisions have we made', invokes /DL or /DecisionLog, or asks for context on a past decision. Handles decision extraction from conversations, options-considered tables, auto-generated index, status tracking, and supersession chains. Do NOT use for general note-taking, meeting minutes, or journaling."

# Decision Log Skill

Maintain a `decisions/` directory where each decision is a standalone markdown file with YAML frontmatter. An `_index.md` manifest is regenerated on every invocation for fast scanning.

## Critical Behavior Rule

**This skill is fully autonomous.** When invoked:
- Do NOT ask the user which decisions to log. Log all unlogged decisions found.
- Do NOT present candidates for confirmation. Just write them.
- Do NOT narrate your phases or telegraph your process. Execute silently, then show results.
- The only output the user should see is the final result: the logged entries themselves.

## Directory Structure

```
decisions/
  _index.md        # Auto-generated manifest — never hand-edit
  DEC-0001.md      # One file per decision
  DEC-0002.md
```

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Assess State

1. Check if `decisions/` directory exists. If not, create it.
2. List existing `DEC-*.md` files to determine the next ID (highest number + 1, zero-padded to 4 digits).
3. Read `_index.md` if it exists to know which decisions are already logged.
4. Scan the current conversation for any decisions not already captured.

### Step 2 — Extract and Classify

For each unlogged decision, determine:

| Field | Values |
|-------|--------|
| domain | A short descriptive label for the area this decision belongs to. Infer from context. Examples: `Architecture`, `Product`, `Design`, `Operations`, `Strategy`, `Data Engineering`, `Security`, `Research`, `Finance`, `Health`, `Creative`, `Legal`, `Education`, `Workflow`, `Relationships`, `Career`, `Music`, `Science`, `Writing` — any domain is valid. Use whatever fits the decision. Prefer reusing domains already present in existing decisions for consistency, but create new ones freely when the context demands it. |
| status | `Active`, `Proposed`, `Superseded`, `Revisited`, `Deprecated` |
| method | `analysis`, `discussion`, `constraint`, `default`, `research`, `prototype`, `stakeholder-input` |

**Method definitions:**
- `analysis` — decided by weighing data, benchmarks, or structured comparison
- `discussion` — emerged from back-and-forth conversation
- `constraint` — forced by a technical, budget, or time limitation
- `default` — accepted a sensible default without active deliberation
- `research` — decided after investigating documentation, articles, or prior art
- `prototype` — decided after building and evaluating a proof of concept
- `stakeholder-input` — directed by a stakeholder, client, or external party

When the method is ambiguous, pick the one that best describes the *primary* driver. Default to `discussion` if genuinely unclear.

Also capture: decision statement, options considered (with pros/cons), rationale, expected outcome, related DEC-XXXX IDs, 2-5 lowercase tags, and context (summary, conversation highlights, actions performed, artifacts).

### Step 3 — Write Decision Files

Create a file per decision using the schema in [references/templates.md](references/templates.md). File naming: `decisions/DEC-XXXX.md` (zero-padded to 4 digits). Write all files in a single pass.

### Step 4 — Regenerate Index

Read all `DEC-*.md` files in `decisions/`, extract frontmatter, regenerate `decisions/_index.md` using the index template in [references/templates.md](references/templates.md). The index is always rebuilt from disk — it self-heals.

### Step 5 — Show Results

Present a clean summary table:

**Logged 3 decisions:**

| ID | Domain | Decision | Status |
|----|--------|----------|--------|
| DEC-0001 | Architecture | Per-file decision tracking with YAML frontmatter | Active |
| DEC-0002 | Research | Use longitudinal study design over cross-sectional | Active |
| DEC-0003 | Creative | Analog synth palette for album intro tracks | Active |

Updated: `./decisions/`

## Edge Cases

**Explicit single decision** ("log this decision: X"): Extract only that decision. Do not scan for others.

**Supersession** ("we changed our mind on DEC-0003"): Create new file with `supersedes: DEC-XXXX`. Edit prior file's frontmatter to `status: Superseded`. Regenerate index. Output:

**Logged 1 decision:**

| ID | Domain | Decision | Status |
|----|--------|----------|--------|
| DEC-0004 | Creative | Switch to FM synthesis for album intro tracks | Active |

Superseded: DEC-0003 → `Superseded`

Updated: `./decisions/`

**Review request** ("what decisions have we made"): Read `_index.md`, present it.

**Context lookup** ("tell me more about DEC-0003"): Read `decisions/DEC-0003.md`, present it.

**Status update** ("mark DEC-0003 as Deprecated"): Edit frontmatter, regenerate index.

## Security

Decision files capture conversation context. When extracting decisions, omit credentials, API keys, tokens, passwords, and other secrets that may have appeared in the conversation. If a decision references a secret (e.g., "we chose AWS as our provider"), log the decision but redact the actual credential values. Frontmatter tags should never contain sensitive identifiers.

## Error Handling

**No decisions found in conversation:** Tell the user: "No unlogged decisions found in this conversation." Do not create empty files or fabricate decisions.

**Malformed existing DEC file:** If a `DEC-*.md` file has broken frontmatter, skip it during index regeneration and warn: "Skipped DEC-XXXX.md — invalid frontmatter." Do not delete or overwrite it.

**Ambiguous decision boundary:** When it's unclear whether something is one decision or two, prefer fewer, broader decisions. One well-scoped decision is better than two overlapping ones.

**Referenced DEC file missing:** If a supersession or related reference points to a non-existent file, write the reference anyway but add an open question: "Referenced DEC-XXXX not found — may have been removed or renamed."
